## Report Overview

According to the [Zero Deaths Maryland](https://zerodeathsmd.gov/resources/crashdata/) website, Maryland has taken a data-driven approach for zero roadway fatalities and serious injuries. We wish to contribute to this cause by analyzing the various causes and effects of vehicle crashes. In this analysis, we took a look at vehicle crash data across the state of Maryland to determine the following factors:  
* What is the chance of injury dependent on impact location at time of collision?
* What is the chance of injury given vehicle body type?
* What effect does weather have on the amount of vehicle crashes?
* What is the correlation between driver distraction and substance abuse and the ACRS (Automated Crash Reporting System) Report Type?
